## Objective

I am currently looking for a Junior QA analyst or a junior QA data analyst position, and can relocate and open over work conditions. 


## My skills

I am currently working well with SQL, API and can write professional reports, with clear profesionalism and neutral language. 
I have a business background, and as such a business view, which I think can be a good bonus. 
I am also co-founder of a company, Elytra, and as such can adapt to a large variety of working pace or environment. 

## My strenght 

I am a fast learner, with a business point of view, which can I think greatly help making comprehensive reports. I add to this an affinity with numbers, and SQL. 

## Working environment

I wish to learn and gain experience over innovative projects, as well as answering my financial needs. 
I can answer almost any time zone, but am currently in Europe, and will need time to adjust.
